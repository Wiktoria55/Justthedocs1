# Tearoom „Daisy”

While in the park, we can visit one of the most picturesque and romantic places - the  tearoom. It is an island with a tea pavilion built in the mid-19th century. In those days it was one of the favorite places of Princess Daisy, who had to reach the island by boat. Currently, you can go there by walking over bridges. The island offers a beautiful view of the castle. In the evening the extraordinary décor and lighting create a magical atmosphere.
